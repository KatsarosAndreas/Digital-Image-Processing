# Image Processing – Laboratory Exercises (Part A)

This repository contains the complete implementation, experimentation, and analysis for **Laboratory Exercise 1** of the *Image Processing* course.  
The work focuses on fundamental and advanced image processing techniques, combining theoretical concepts with practical MATLAB implementations.

The repository is structured to clearly separate each exercise, provide well-documented code, and demonstrate reproducible results suitable for academic evaluation and research-oriented portfolios.

---

## Overview

The exercises cover the following major topics:

- Frequency-domain image processing using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Image compression using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
- Noise modeling and denoising techniques
- Histogram analysis and contrast enhancement
- Comparative evaluation using quantitative metrics (MSE, PSNR)

All implementations are written in **MATLAB**, using `.mlx` live scripts for clarity, visualization, and step-by-step explanation.
